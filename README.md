# MYSQL-Project
This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data from 45 stores to identify top-performing branches and products, understand sales trends, and study customer behavior to improve and optimize sales strategies. Also, to add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales.
